Advent of code 2017
===================

Here is my take on the [Advent of Code 2017](http://adventofcode.com/2017) using Python.

I got inspired by Joel Grus (and its fantastic [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o64FV-ez6Gw) on building a machine learning library in 40 min) for using Python type annotation and checking with [`mypy`](http://mypy-lang.org/). This is **pretty cool**.
